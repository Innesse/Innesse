## [Project 1: Test Data Generation for Machine Learning.](https://github.com/Innesse/Test-data-creation-automation)
### Descripton:
The Python function, that generates synthetic test data for machine learning tasks in pricing and demand prediction. It is useful for simulating scenarios where you want to test your machine learning models against varying product prices, quantities, and elasticities.
### The Result:
Test data with a real-world distribution which is valuable for testing and validating predictive models. Its resemblance to actual data ensures unbiased testing and more reliable results.
